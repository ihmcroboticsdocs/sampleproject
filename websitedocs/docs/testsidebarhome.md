## What is Euclid?
Euclid is a library that defines geometries such as lines and convex polygons, and also shapes such as cylinders and boxes.
The library is born from the need of having a base library for geometric applications that is well tested, flexible, and meant for real-time environment where
garbage generation is not allowed.
This library will be extended over the next months as the result of migrating progressively content from the IHMC open source software [here](https://github.com/ihmcrobotics/ihmc-open-robotics-software).

## How does Euclid work
The idea is to facilitate the manipulation with geometries by providing classes for each type of geometry this library consider.
The user can then simply instantiate one of these classes and then interact with the geometry through the class API.
Examples will be provided as the library is being extended.

## Who would use Euclid?
Any software developer manipulating geometry objects or dealing with 2D or 3D graphical UI is susceptible to use this library as the base of a more complex algorithm.

## What is the goal of Euclid?
The goal for Euclid is to become the most flexible, easy to use, and fast library for geometry applications, so it results in great increase in development productivity.
